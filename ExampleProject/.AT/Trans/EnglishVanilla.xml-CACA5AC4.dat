This is unfortunately so common that throwing every traitorous submariner out the airlock would be detrimental to the submarine fleets and the Europan labor force as a whole. The Code of Fair Disciplinary Actions provides guidelines for dealing with traitors or other troublesome crewmates in a just manner.\\n\\nLevel 1 Offenses:\\nDescription: mostly harmless misdemeanors, \"pranks,\" neglect of assigned duties. Acts that at most cause minor inconvenience to the rest of the crew.\\nSuggested disciplinary actions: Notify the person of their misconduct and command them back to their duties. A baton or some other non-lethal tool may be used to accentuate the verbal commands. More severe disciplinary actions can be considered if the misconduct continues.\\n\\nLevel 2 Offenses:\\nDescription: acts that may endanger the health of the crew or submarine, such as intentional mishandling of devices or substances.\\nSuggested disciplinary actions: Similar to level 1 offenses, a simple disciplining can suffice, but depending on the misconduct security can deem it necessary to instead handcuff or detain the individual by other means\\n\\nLevel 3 Offenses:\\nDescription: clearly hostile acts with the intention to cause severe injuries or the death of one or more crewmates.\\nSuggested disciplinary actions: Disposing of the traitor as soon as possible is advised. The disposal should preferably be carried out in a humane way, but it is understandable if such means are not available or feasible for one reason or another.</securityofficer.traitor.guidelines>\n","MatchPosList":[{"BeginPos":36,"Length":1685,"ReplaceStr":""}],"TranslationText":"","MatchNum":3499},{"IsRawText":false,"TextState":0,"LineNum":3550,"RawText":"<entityname.idcardfakesootman>ID

If an overheated reactor is not shut down, it will eventually lead to a nuclear meltdown.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Most submarines are equipped with stationary batteries that can be used as a temporary source of backup power in the case of a reactor failure.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Railgun shells and depth charges include a compartment that can hold additional explosives.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Passive sonar can be used to detect nearby sound sources without attracting unwanted attention. You can also get a rough idea of your surroundings based on the sounds reflected from the ice walls.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>There are many ways to get past locked doors, including forcing them open with a crowbar or rewiring them to a button you have access to.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Stationary batteries are equipped with docks that can be used to charge battery cells.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Oxygen generators are equipped with docks that can be used to refill oxygen tanks.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Supercapacitors can deliver large bursts of power, but cannot store as much energy as batteries. They are often used to power railguns and other devices that require brief bursts of high current.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Nuclear reactors are equipped with an automatic control system that adjusts the power output to a suitable level when enabled. However, the system is not always fast enough to react to large fluctuations in power consumption.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>The sonar imaging on the navigation terminal may become inaccurate if the terminal is damaged—make sure your engineers keep the terminal in a good condition!</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>When deploying a decoy, be sure to deactivate your active sonar for best results.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Attempting to rewire powered devices without adequate electrical engineering skills may get you electrocuted.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Welding tools are simple enough to be used by any submariner, but trained mechanics are generally faster welders and have a lower risk of injuring themselves with the tool.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>All submariners have been trained to do basic repairs on electrical devices, but electrical engineers get the job done much faster.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>All submariners have been trained to do basic repairs on mechanical devices, but mechanics get the job done much faster.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Captains are generally much more adept at maneuvering the submarine than the average sailor.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>If the reactor on a sub is not able to produce sufficient power to run all onboard systems, try reducing the charge rate for the onboard batteries and supercapacitors, or regulate the times when the sub is running at full speed.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>The electrical and mechanical systems on a sub will gradually degrade due to the harsh conditions and constant wear and tear. Be sure to have mechanics and engineers perform maintenance from time to time in order to avoid breakdowns at inopportune moments.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Breaking down alien artifacts in a deconstructor may provide you with exotic raw materials.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Some of the alien structures on Europa have been constructed of a metamaterial that's outstandingly resistant to physical damage, and as such has become an important subject of research to Europan scientists.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Special caution must be taken when bringing alien artifacts on board the submarine.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Very little is known of the presumably extinct alien civilization that built the ruins scattered all across Europa. The age of the ruins is also a mystery, since the self-repairing properties of the structures and devices make chronological dating methods wildly inaccurate.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>No remains of the alien lifeforms that built the ruins scattered all across Europa have ever been discovered. The only life encountered inside the structures are the biomechanical entities that maintain and guard them.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>While exploring ruins or caves, drop flares as often as possible to help mark a path out, should you need to make a hasty exit for some reason.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Watchers are docile but inquisitive creatures: Despite having no desire to attack submarines, they frequently approach ships to gaze at human activities.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Cannibalistic behavior is very common among crawlers. Killing one in a swarm may distract the rest as they enter into a feeding frenzy.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Mudraptors can easily tear their way through metal doors with their sharp beaks.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>The so-called husk parasites slowly take over and consume the body of their host, eventually turning them into nothing but an empty exoskeleton controlled by the parasite.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Many creatures on Europa are protected by a strong shell, and are difficult to damage with conventional weapons, though there may be weak points in their armor.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Loud devices and sonar pings may alert nearby creatures.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Performing CPR without adequate medical skills may cause internal damage to the patient.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Opiates such as morphine and fentanyl are an effective way of treating injuries in an emergency, but regular use may eventually lead to a state of addiction and cause dangerous withdrawal symptoms.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Bleeding wounds can be treated with bandages and hemostatic agents. The patient may also need saline or blood packs to replace the lost blood.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Mental disorders such as psychosis are unfortunately common among submarine crews, particularly after ruin expeditions. If your crewmates start seeing or hearing things others don't see or hear, report it to a medical doctor immediately.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>The medical doctors' main task is to keep the crew in a good shape, but a medic with a syringe gun and a bit of knowhow on poisons can also be very useful in fending off intruders.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Many drugs may have unintended side effects. Keep an eye on the patient and be ready to administer additional medications to counteract these side effects if necessary.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>When using a diving mask, be careful not to mix up welding fuel tanks and oxygen tanks.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Diving masks let you breathe underwater, but don't offer any protection against the bone-crushing pressure outside the submarine. If there's a major hull breach, find a diving suit immediately.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>In the event of a fire, burns are not the only thing to watch out for—fires can quickly consume all the oxygen inside the submarine.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Traversing the so-called Hydrothermal Wastes requires special caution. Not only are they abundant in wildlife, but the water currents caused by geothermal activity make navigation even more hazardous.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Some of the sessile lifeforms in Europa emit low-frequency sounds that may disrupt the submarine's sonar.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Europa is rich in natural resources, and an enterprising captain with a sharp eye and a plasma cutter may stand to make a tidy profit.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>You can disguise yourself as someone else by wearing their ID card and something that covers your face.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>It's possible to build voice-controlled systems by linking wifi components to the radio chat in the submarine editor.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>The radiation belts around Jupiter make it impracticable to establish permanent settlements above Europa's surface, and as such almost all Europan outposts are located below its icy crust.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>The dynamics of Europa's underwater ecosystem are still not fully understood, but it is believed that the base of the food chain is mostly formed by chemosynthetic bacteria.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>The Europa Coalition started off as a trade and cooperation agreement between the two largest Europan settlements and a handful of private paramilitary groups, but gradually grew to become what is essentially the Europan government.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>The much-ridiculed initiative to help submariners cope in a high-stress environment by including professional entertainers in the crews was promptly deemed a failure and discontinued.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Most vessels avoid venturing outside the tunnels and cracks within Europa's icy crust—the vast, empty Abyss between the surface layers and the rocky interior hosts many of Europa's largest and most dangerous inhabitants.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>If left undisturbed for several years, a colony of ballast flora can eventually grow into a Thalamus, an intelligent organism capable of exerting some degree of control over the systems of the submarine it's inhabiting.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>You can give context-sensitive commands when the cursor is over a usable object by holding down shift and opening the command interface.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Making trouble at an outpost hurts your reputation. A bad reputation might cause the inhabitants of the outpost to charge you a premium for their services, or, in more extreme cases, lead to a confrontation with their security.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Many Europan outposts don't recognize the Coalition's authority, although it is still powerful enough that few dare to openly oppose it. However, there are groups such as the Jovian Separatists who do fight against it, aiming to bring it down and create a more democratic society.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Behold the Watcher. Don't lose your mind.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Straddling the border between surface ice and the denser, rockier subsurface ice layer, the Europan Ridge is the area along the western-most slope of the Eye of Europa. Warmer water is convected into this area, allowing a wider array of life to subsist.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>The Aphotic Plateau sits atop the western rim of an ancient impact crater known as the Eye of Europa. As with the neighboring Europan Ridge, the Plateau’s tunnel networks consist mostly of dark, rocky ice pressed as hard as any stone by the unimaginable weight of the ice above it.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Most of the human habitation on Europa is situated in the so-called Cold Caverns. Due to the cold water and relative proximity to the surface, this biome is biologically less diverse than others, primarily hosting moderate concentrations of crawlers and practically no vegetation.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Ice spires are enormous icy projections that sometimes burst through the subsurface tunnels under Europa's crust. Submarine crews are advised to avoid any contact with the spires, or to destroy any they come across, as the sharp edges can easily tear through a submarine's hull.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>The poorly understood \"Piezo Crystals\" found in The Great Sea pose some extra challenges to crews travelling through the region: Navigating too close to one may cause disruptions in the submarine's electrical grid.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Administering drugs without sufficient medical knowledge may reduce the quality of the effects of the drug.</loadingscreentip>\n<loadingscreentip>Generating more power than your sub's devices require leads to overvoltage, which can be used to push some devices (such as engines and pumps) past their normal capacity. However, a too-high voltage level may also damage devices.</loadingscreentip>\n\n<!-- Main menu labels -->\n<campaignlabel>Campaign</campaignlabel>\n<multiplayerlabel>Multiplayer</multiplayerlabel>\n<customizelabel>Customize</customizelabel>\n<privacypolicy>Privacy policy</privacypolicy>\n\n<!-- Main menu buttons -->\n<tutorialbutton>Training</tutorialbutton>\n<newgamebutton>New Game</newgamebutton>\n<loadgamebutton>Load Game</loadgamebutton>\n<joinserverbutton>Server browser</joinserverbutton>\n<hostserverbutton>Host Server</hostserverbutton>\n<subeditorbutton>Submarine Editor</subeditorbutton>\n<charactereditorbutton>Character Editor</charactereditorbutton>\n<settingsbutton>Settings</settingsbutton>\n<steamworkshopbutton>Steam Workshop</steamworkshopbutton>\n<creditsbutton>Credits</creditsbutton>\n<quitbutton>Quit</quitbutton>\n\n<!-- Pause menu -->\n<pausemenuresume>Resume</pausemenuresume>\n<pausemenusettings>Settings</pausemenusettings>\n<pausemenuretry>Retry</pausemenuretry>\n<pausemenusavequit>Save and Quit</pausemenusavequit>\n<pausemenuquit>Main Menu</pausemenuquit>\n<pausemenuquitverification>Are you sure you want to return to the main menu?

This is unfortunately so common that throwing every traitorous submariner out the airlock would be detrimental to the submarine fleets and the Europan labor force as a whole. The Code of Fair Disciplinary Actions provides guidelines for dealing with traitors or other troublesome crewmates in a just manner.\\n\\nLevel 1 Offenses:\\nDescription: mostly harmless misdemeanors, \"pranks,\" neglect of assigned duties. Acts that at most cause minor inconvenience to the rest of the crew.\\nSuggested disciplinary actions: Notify the person of their misconduct and command them back to their duties. A baton or some other non-lethal tool may be used to accentuate the verbal commands. More severe disciplinary actions can be considered if the misconduct continues.\\n\\nLevel 2 Offenses:\\nDescription: acts that may endanger the health of the crew or submarine, such as intentional mishandling of devices or substances.\\nSuggested disciplinary actions: Similar to level 1 offenses, a simple disciplining can suffice, but depending on the misconduct security can deem it necessary to instead handcuff or detain the individual by other means\\n\\nLevel 3 Offenses:\\nDescription: clearly hostile acts with the intention to cause severe injuries or the death of one or more crewmates.\\nSuggested disciplinary actions: Disposing of the traitor as soon as possible is advised. The disposal should preferably be carried out in a humane way, but it is understandable if such means are not available or feasible for one reason or another.</securityofficer.traitor.guidelines>\n<entityname.idcardfakesootman>ID Card</entityname.idcardfakesootman>\n<entitydescription.idcardfakesootman>This belongs to Sootman, the notorious masked vigilante.</entitydescription.idcardfakesootman>\n<radiojammer.transmit>Transmit</radiojammer.transmit>\n<entityname.radiojammer>Radio Jammer</entityname.radiojammer>\n<entitydescription.radiojammer>A portable, battery-powered device that temporarily blocks radio communications.</entitydescription.radiojammer>\n<radiojammedwarning>Radio jammed</radiojammedwarning>\n\n<!-- Alien -->\n<entityname.skyholderartifact>Sky Alien Artifact</entityname.skyholderartifact>\n<entitydescription.skyholderartifact>Artifact found in alien ruins.</entitydescription.skyholderartifact>\n<entityname.thermalartifact>Thermal Alien Artifact</entityname.thermalartifact>\n<entitydescription.thermalartifact>Artifact found in alien ruins.</entitydescription.thermalartifact>\n<entityname.faradayartifact>Faraday Alien Artifact</entityname.faradayartifact>\n<entitydescription.faradayartifact>Artifact found in alien ruins.</entitydescription.faradayartifact>\n<entityname.nasonovartifact>Nasonov Alien Artifact</entityname.nasonovartifact>\n<entitydescription.nasonovartifact>Artifact found in alien ruins.</entitydescription.nasonovartifact>\n<entityname.psychosisartifact>Psychosis Alien Artifact</entityname.psychosisartifact>\n<entitydescription.psychosisartifact>Artifact found in alien ruins.</entitydescription.psychosisartifact>\n<entityname.alientrinket1>Alien Trinket</entityname.alientrinket1>\n<entitydescription.alientrinket1>Minor artifact found in alien ruins.</entitydescription.alientrinket1>\n<entityname.alientrinket2>Alien Curio</entityname.alientrinket2>\n<entitydescription.alientrinket2>Minor artifact found in alien ruins.</entitydescription.alientrinket2>\n<entityname.alientrinket3>Alien Ornament</entityname.alientrinket3>\n<entitydescription.alientrinket3>Minor artifact found in alien ruins.</entitydescription.alientrinket3>\n<entityname.oxygeniteshard>Oxygenite Shard</entityname.oxygeniteshard>\n<entitydescription.oxygeniteshard>An alien mineral.</entitydescription.oxygeniteshard>\n<entityname.sulphuriteshard>Sulphurite Shard</entityname.sulphuriteshard>\n<entitydescription.sulphuriteshard>An alien mineral.</entitydescription.sulphuriteshard>\n<entityname.ancientweapon>Ancient Weapon</entityname.ancientweapon>\n<entitydescription.ancientweapon>A weapon with powerful capabilities.</entitydescription.ancientweapon>\n<entityname.alienhatch>Alien Hatch</entityname.alienhatch>\n<entitydescription.alienhatch>A horizontal hatch for alien ruins.</entitydescription.alienhatch>\n<entityname.aliendoor>Alien Door</entityname.aliendoor>\n<entitydescription.aliendoor>A vertical door for alien ruins.</entitydescription.aliendoor>\n<entityname.alienmotionsensor>Alien Motion Sensor</entityname.alienmotionsensor>\n<entitydescription.alienmotionsensor>A motion detector used by aliens.</entitydescription.alienmotionsensor>\n<entityname.artifactholder>Artifact Holder</entityname.artifactholder>\n<entitydescription.artifactholder>For holding major artifacts.</entitydescription.artifactholder>\n<entityname.aliengenerator>Alien Generator</entityname.aliengenerator>\n<entitydescription.aliengenerator>Converts alien power cells to electricity.</entitydescription.aliengenerator>\n<entityname.alienpowercell>Alien Power Cell</entityname.alienpowercell>\n<entitydescription.alienpowercell>An alien power source.</entitydescription.alienpowercell>\n<entityname.alienpump>Alien Pump</entityname.alienpump>\n<entitydescription.alienpump>Used to pump water in and out of ruins.</entitydescription.alienpump>\n<entityname.alienbutton>Alien Button</entityname.alienbutton>\n<entitydescription.alienbutton>Sends a signal to alien mechanisms.</entitydescription.alienbutton>\n<entityname.alienturret>Alien Turret</entityname.alienturret>\n<entitydescription.alienturret>A stationary turret found in alien ruins.</entitydescription.alienturret>\n<entityname.alienturretammo>Alien Projectile</entityname.alienturretammo>\n<entitydescription.alienturretammo>Fired from alien turrets.</entitydescription.alienturretammo>\n<entityname.aliencoil>Alien Coil</entityname.aliencoil>\n<entitydescription.aliencoil>Discharges electricity;

Its two engines and three ballasts require a copious amount of power to operate, and keeping the machinery in good working condition is a handful for even a moderately large crew.</submarine.description.berilia>\n<submarine.name.kastrull>Kastrull</submarine.name.kastrull>\n<submarine.description.kastrull>The Kastrull is a dependable attack sub class bringing plenty of firepower to any fight, and although it's not very nimble, it does sport a drone gunship as standard. Keep in mind that with its experimental open ballast tanks, low tolerance to flooding and numerous crew stations, a large, experienced crew will get the most out of this sub.</submarine.description.kastrull>\n<submarine.name.hemulen>Hemulen</submarine.name.hemulen>\n<submarine.description.hemulen>For when you need extra room to stretch your legs or want some space between you and the poor, choose Hemulen shuttles.</submarine.description.hemulen>\n<submarine.name.typhon2>Typhon 2</submarine.name.typhon2>\n<submarine.description.typhon2>Typhon 2 is an overhauled version of the venerable Typhon class of sub.

Original design by rav2n.</submarine.description.r-29>\n<submarine.name.barsuk>Barsuk</submarine.name.barsuk>\n<submarine.description.barsuk>Barsuk is a favorite among beginner captains. Using materials out of recycled hulls of destroyed submarines (many of which were Barsuks anyway) keeps the price of the line down.

The Camel has an extensive medic bay and ample cargo space, but it handles flooding poorly. The front ballast tank is a liability, and some less-liked crewmembers may have found an untimely death in an \"accident\" there. Trivia: The two humps are welded to the submarine during missions, but they can still be detached relatively easily when needed to supply heavier equipment to stations.</submarine.description.camel>\n\n<!-- Terminal welcome messages -->\n<terminalwelcomemsg.humpback>Type \"on\" or \"off\" to either connect batteries to power grid or disconnect them.

We're navigating through a newly discovered gap in the ice, trying to find a shorter route to Novaya Moskva.\\n\\nIt's not the safest of missions, but hopefully it'll be my last. Should be able to retire after this one.\\n\\nDay 3. Cap says the whole voyage shouldn't take more than six days. By my reckoning that should place us somewhere around halfway there.\\n\\nCourse there's always a chance this cave doesn't actually have an exit and we'll have to turn back.\\n\\nDay 4. Now if I were a superstitious man, I'd wager that saying the worst outcome in any given situation out loud makes it come true. Turns out this route is a dead end.\\n\\nCaptain is bummed out. I share his disappointment. It'll take a few days longer to get to an outpost now that we have to go back.\\n\\nDay 8. There was a hole in the ice here. It's gone now. Icebergs must've moved and closed it. We've started broadcasting our position in hopes that someone picks it up. They're joking now, asking me why I chose my last expedition to get lost at sea.\\n\\nDay 9. We're rationing food and water. Crew is getting ornery.\\n\\nDay 11? 12? No response. Food's running out. More concerned about water, myself. Don't feel like writing any more.\\n\\nDay 30-ish, who cares anymore? I'm surrounded by dead men. Pale husks of men slumped on the floor. Some of their eyes still move, but they're dead nonetheless.\\n</terminalwelcomemsg.kastrulldiary1>\n<terminalwelcomemsg.dugongtransmission>Replaying last outgoing transmissions.\\n[2451-3-4 11:33] DG-35 calling for Tara colony.

Then make your way to the airlock. Be sure to close all the doors behind you to stop the water’s flow before too much of it gets inside.\\n\\nWhen coming back inside, use water pumps to drain all of the water before going deeper into the submarine.

It must be readily available during long transits aboard submarines, which is made possible by oxygen generators. They pump air through ventilation to different rooms and can be used to refill oxygen tanks.\\n\\nTo refill oxygen tanks, interact ([InteractType.Use]) with the generator to open its inventory. Insert an empty oxygen tank into one of the slots to start refilling it. When the tank is full, drag it back to your inventory or into your diving suit/mask.</tutorial.oxygendescription>\n<tutorial.laddertitle>Ladders</tutorial.laddertitle>\n<tutorial.ladderdescription>To grab onto a ladder, press {0}.

They require fuel to create heat and a crewmember to regulate the output.\\n\\nDrag a fuel rod to the item slot on the left side. Multiple fuel rods create more heat, but in normal circumstances one is enough and any more might cause the reactor to overheat.\\n\\nStart by setting the fission rate so that the needle is on green, then do the same for turbine output. You can see load and output values to the right. Try to keep the output as close to load as possible; a lower output can lead to power outages, and higher to overvoltage and fires.\\n\\nWhen the reactor operator leaves the interface, consider turning on automatic control. With automatic control, the reactor responds to any fluctuations in grid load, but it is considerably slower than a human operator.</engineer.powerupreactortext>\n\n<!-- Captain tutorial -->\n<captain.docktext>To dock the submarine, maneuver the ship’s and outpost’s docking ports close to each other and toggle the docking clamps. Ports are displayed in green on the sonar display.\\n\\nWhen the ports are close to each other, a line will be shown on the sonar display. When the line is fully green, close the clamps by pressing the “Dock” button. The submarine will then be locked into position until undocked.\\n\\nWhen positioning the submarine for docking, radical movements can easily cause you to overshoot your target. Using autopilot and “maintain position” is helpful in setting the position you want the submarine to move to.</captain.docktext>\n\n<!-- Karma system -->\n<karma>Karma</karma>\n<karmaexplanation>Karma reflects the helpful and harmful actions you've taken while playing.

Uh huh… Yeah. I made sure they swallowed ‘em. ...I don’t know, maybe three minutes ago?” That’s weird, you think to yourself. Hopefully nothing weird comes out of this.</eventtext.outbreak.c1>\n<eventtext.outbreak.o1>OK.</eventtext.outbreak.o1>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot1.c1>Someone has set up shop in their dorm room. A sign on the door says “Mike the Scryer: He’ll divine answers to all your questions!”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.c1>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1>Step inside.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.c1>You peek inside. Heavy curtains line the walls that are otherwise full of crudely drawn pictures of monsters, expensive submarines and well-endowed women. In the middle of the room is a round table with a couple of empty bottles of Europan moonshine and a crystal ball. A man wearing thick glasses and a sloppily tied turban is sitting behind the table. He squints and motions you to take a seat. “I’m Mike,” he croaks. “5 marks to ask me anything.”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.c1>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1>Pay him.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.c1>You sit down at the table opposite Mike.

They shatter on the floor. “Shit.” Mike slumps down dejectedly. “There’s no God,” he mutters as he pushes himself up and starts for the cleaning closet. “Session’s over.”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1.c1>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1.o1>All right.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1.o1>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2>“What do you reckon is in the center of Europa?”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2.c1>Mike blinks. “What? I don’t know. Lava? Or is it magma in this case?” He turns toward a bunk. “Hey Jimmy! Is it lava if it’s underground or magma?” A bundle of sheets stirs a bit. “What is–? Fuck off Mike, I’m sleeping,” it mumbles back. Mike scratches the back of his head. “It’s gotta be one or the other. What else could it be?” He chuckles and flashes his rotting teeth. “A gateway to Earth? Ridiculous.”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2.c1>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2.o1>Yeah, I guess it is.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2.o1>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3>“What’s up with the clowns?”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3.c1>“Funny little fuckers, aren’t they?” Mike leans back in his chair. It squeaks in protest. “The legend has it that a cargo ship carrying entertainment supplies wrecked somewhere near Uusi-Turcu. They recovered a single survivor weeks later. She was wearing a striped shirt, rubber mask and gibbering something about a 'Honkmother' who had kept her company.” He picks his nose and pensively inspects his findings. “Ever since, there’s been a group of ‘em what worships the Honkmother.” “Really?” you ask, enthralled. He flicks the booger off. “No. But that’s all I got.”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3.c1>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3.o1>...I want my money back.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3.o1>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o2>Back out.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o2>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o2>Ignore all charlatans.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o2>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot2.c1>You run into a familiar face.

A bit worse for wear though, am I right?” He flashes a toothless smile and fishes out a lighter from his pocket. “I had a pen pal there a few years back, you know? A real prolific writer. No wonder, you ought to get a lot of writing done with twelve fingers.” He lights the cigarette, takes a drag and coughs his lungs out. “Fuck me!” He exclaims after the fit subsides. “People really smoke these things?” He tosses the whole pack in the trash. “Not for me.”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1.c1>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1.o1>Good to know.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1.o1>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2>“What happened to Mantises?”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2.c1>“Oh, them? Natural selection. Some things are just better suited for survival.” He rolls up his sleeve, revealing a crude tattoo that states: “I fuck with boots on.” He continues: “Tougher. Faster. Prettier. Only the strong come out on top.” A passerby tosses a soda can on the floor and Mike bends to pick it up. “Apex predators, that’s what we are,” he declares as he places the can in the trash.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2.c1>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2.o1>Truth.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2.o1>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3>“Why would someone shoot a man before throwing him out of an airlock?”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3>\n<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3.c1>“It’s all part of the plan,” Mike muses. “Sending a message.

This discovery sent shockwaves through the scientific community.\\n\\nIn the year 2022, the first manned space flight arrived on Europa to discover that the moon was indeed already sustaining life, in the form of hostile sub-aquatic fauna. Besides the wildlife, the researchers faced gruelling difficulties posed by the dangerous radiation emitted from Jupiter and the intense cold and tremendous pressure of the Europan ocean.\\n\\nDespite all their hardships, Earth-born colonists were able to construct a handful of habitable outposts where a new way of life developed over many decades. A new system of governance was formed by a coalition of the largest, most influential cities on the moon. Different industries made their mark in the new world, including mining, manufacturing and chemical laboratories.\\n\\nOver the years, Europan society became more and more dissociated from Earth. Fifty years ago, contact was lost entirely, and no more supply ships have arrived since.\\n\\nSub-aquatic travel and vehicles are in a key role in this new society, scouting for new inhabitable locations, protecting citizens from creature attacks and establishing supply lines between stations as humanity ventures ever deeper to evade the lethal radiation from Jupiter above. The life of a crewmember aboard one of these submarines is a lucrative one, albeit dangerous and often short.\\n\\nYou have enlisted to serve on a yyyy-class submarine, docked at xxxx. The waters of Europa open up before you—explore, help expand the colonies, and make of this place what you will.</campaignstart>\n<campaignend1>Hints of what are to come flash before your eyes: a crystalline space, something coiled within itself slumbering fitfully.
